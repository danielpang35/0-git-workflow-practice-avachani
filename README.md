What I found particularly interesting about this article is how Tony mentioned that working from home is the best part of his job but also the worst. There are very few careers other than Software Engineering that can run smoothly without an office or a location that employees meet. That being said, I previously had a job experience fully remote and felt very similar to Tony. While I really enjoyed having the option to get more sleep and wear comfortable clothes throughout the day, something felt missing and I wouldn't describe my experience as fulfilling. To anyone reading this, let me know your thoughts on WFH. Have you worked remotely before, what do you think about it? etc...
